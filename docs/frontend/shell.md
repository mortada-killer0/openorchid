# OpenOrchid Shell

The shell is the user interface and user experience of OpenOrchid.
It's the thing you see at boot, login and basically everywhere. It's the OS' GUI.

It uses Chromium and Node.js to function and create the interface seen.

In a fresh unmodified install. It's usually located at:
```
/system/chrome
```
